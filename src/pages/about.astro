    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm Chris, and, right now, I'm working through Astro's introductory tutorial, as I heard it was the hot new thing. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>
    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so, keep checking back if you are so inclined.</p>

		<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
			<li>I live in {identity.country} and I work in {identity.occupation}</li>
			{identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
				<li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
			}
		</ul>
		<p>My skills are:</p>
		<ul>
			{skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
		</ul>

		{happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

		{finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

		{goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
