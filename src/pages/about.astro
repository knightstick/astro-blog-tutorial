    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm Chris, and, right now, I'm working through Astro's introductory tutorial, as I heard it was the hot new thing. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>
    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so, keep checking back if you are so inclined.</p>
